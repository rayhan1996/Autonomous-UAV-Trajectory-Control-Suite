# Telemetry Event Logs

This directory contains **high-level operational events** generated by the control
software during UAV missions.

Unlike the CSV logs (which store continuous state such as position, velocity,
and attitude), these files record **discrete timeline events** that describe
what the system was doing at important moments.

---

## What is stored here?

Examples of recorded events:

- Vehicle arming / disarming
- Takeoff and landing attempts
- Offboard activation
- Control loop start / stop
- Operator input detection
- Safety limit violations
- Communication or RPC failures

Each entry is timestamped using Unix time.

Example:

1767780131.097266 OFFBOARD_STARTED
1767780197.100260 FIRST_KEY_RECEIVED
1767780197.101023 ALT_LIMIT_EXCEEDED alt=0.31m (limits 1.0-4.0)

## Why this is useful

These logs help to:

- reconstruct the **mission timeline**
- debug unexpected behavior
- verify safety mechanisms
- understand interaction between operator and autonomy
- correlate events with the numerical data stored in `/logs/csv`

---

## Current missions

At the moment, event logging is mainly implemented for the  
**Keyboard Velocity Control** experiments.

---

## Future improvements

Possible extensions include:

- per-mission log separation
- automatic synchronization with trajectory plots
- event overlay for performance evaluation
